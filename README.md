# Web Development Learning Platform – Frontend Demo

A single-page **imaginary platform** designed purely for learning **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and understanding **frontend website development** concepts. This project is **only a static homepage design**, showcasing how a documentation-based learning platform could look. It’s built **without any backend** — perfect for beginners practicing layout, design, and interaction concepts. Click **[Here](https://web-development-learning-platform-d.vercel.app/)** to see the live demo.

**[UI, color theme, and structure are entirely designed and developed by me — no HTML template or copied design was used.]**
